# 8-Puzzle-Solver-with-Heuristic-Search-Visualization

This Python script utilizes the Processing library to generate and solve a 8-puzzle. The script employs heuristic search, specifically counting misplaced tiles, to explore and find the optimal path to the goal configuration. The visualization allows you to observe the intermediate steps of the solving process.

Instructions

Requirements:
Python with the Processing library installed.

Setup:
Ensure you have the Processing library installed for Python.
Run the script in a Python environment.

Usage:
The sliding puzzle will be generated and solved using heuristic search.
Observe the visualization of the solving process.

Visualization:
The script uses the Processing library for visualization.
The setup function initializes the canvas, and the draw function displays the puzzle states.
A delay of 1000 milliseconds between frames helps in visualizing the solving process.

Acknowledgments:
The heuristic search is implemented using a simple heuristic of counting misplaced tiles.
